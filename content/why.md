title: Why you should use CPIs
---

Using Cross-Program Invocations allows your Solana programs to interact with each other efficiently.
This interaction promotes modularity, reusability, and composability, enabling you to build more sophisticated and interconnected applications on the Solana blockchain.
By leveraging CPIs, you can create programs that are both powerful and flexible, capable of performing complex operations through coordinated programmatic interactions.

## Enhance Functionality and Complexity

Using CPIs allows your Solana program to enhance its functionality by leveraging existing programs. Instead of reinventing the wheel, your program can invoke instructions from other programs to perform tasks such as token transfers, complex mathematical computations, or interacting with DeFi protocols.
This capability enables you to build sophisticated applications without the need to write every single functionality from scratch.

## Promote Modularity and Reusability

By incorporating CPIs, you can design your programs in a modular fashion. Each program can focus on a specific set of tasks and expose certain functionalities that other programs can invoke.
This approach promotes reusability, as well-tested and optimized programs can serve as building blocks for new applications.
For example, a program that manages user authentication can be reused across multiple applications, ensuring consistent and secure user management.

## Enable Interoperability

Interoperability is a significant advantage of using CPIs. Programs on the Solana blockchain can interact seamlessly with each other, enabling a high level of interoperability. T
his interaction allows developers to create more integrated and cohesive ecosystems where different applications and services can work together to provide a more comprehensive user experience.
For example, a decentralized exchange (DEX) can use a CPI to interact with a lending protocol, allowing users to trade assets and simultaneously earn interest on their holdings.

## Optimize Development Time and Resources

Leveraging CPIs can significantly reduce development time and resources. Instead of developing all functionalities in-house, developers can utilize existing programs to handle certain tasks.
This approach not only accelerates the development process but also ensures that the functionalities being used are robust and well-tested. As a result, developers can focus more on the unique aspects of their application, leading to more innovative and higher-quality products.
